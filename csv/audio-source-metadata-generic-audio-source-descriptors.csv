urn:mpeg:mpegB:cicp:OutputChannelPosition|ISO/IEC 23091-3|/identifiers/references#23091-3|clause 6.1|OutputChannelPosition specifies the association of loudspeaker positions to a given audio channel according to Table 7. Table 7 indicates the loudspeaker position in the 3D environment of the listener. In order to ease the understanding of loudspeaker positions Table 7 also contains loudspeaker positions according to IEC 62574, which are listed here for information to the interested reader.
urn:mpeg:mpegB:cicp:ProgramLoudness|ISO/IEC 23091-3|/identifiers/references#23091-3|clause 6.4|ProgramLoudness indicates the overall loudness of the corresponding audio program. It should be measured in such a way, that if two pieces of content have their loudness normalized using the value of  rogramLoudness,  the resulting audio will have consistent loudness. Decoders evaluate this value and apply an appropriate level shift to audio to maintain a consistent loudness of output audio, matched with a user-given target loudness. The ProgramLoudness should be the overall loudness measured in LKFS according to Rec. ITU-R BS.1770.
urn:mpeg:mpegB:cicp:AnchorLoudness|ISO/IEC 23091-3|/identifiers/references#23091-3|clause 6.5|AnchorLoudness indicates the loudness of the anchor elements of the corresponding audio signal (usually the dialog). The method of identifying the anchor elements is chosen by the content author and is out of scope for this part of ISO/IEC 23001. It should be chosen in such a way, that if two pieces of content have their loudness normalized using the values of anchorLoudness, the anchor elements of the resulting audio will have consistent loudness. The AnchorLoudness should be the loudness of the anchor content of the program, measured in LKFS according to Rec. ITU-R BS.1770.
